### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a JavaScript web dev student at [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/) ðŸš€ 
I studied Biology and earned my PhD in Geosciences. My scientific research focused on biogeography and marine biodiversity patterns.
I am currently living in Bonn, Germany. 
Thanks for visiting and I'd love to connect!
